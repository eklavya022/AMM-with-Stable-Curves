# AMM with Stable Curves

## Project Description

AMM with Stable Curves is a specialized Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed specifically for stablecoin trading on the Stacks blockchain. Unlike traditional constant product AMMs (x*y=k), this implementation uses stable curve mathematics to provide significantly reduced slippage and better price stability when trading between assets of similar value, particularly stablecoins.

The protocol implements a stable swap algorithm that maintains low slippage even for large trades between stablecoins, making it ideal for efficient stablecoin-to-stablecoin exchanges with minimal price impact.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create the most efficient and reliable stablecoin trading infrastructure on the Stacks ecosystem. We aim to:

- **Minimize Trading Costs**: Reduce slippage and trading fees for stablecoin swaps
- **Enhance DeFi Accessibility**: Provide seamless stablecoin liquidity for all users
- **Foster Ecosystem Growth**: Support the broader Stacks DeFi ecosystem by offering essential stablecoin infrastructure
- **Maintain Price Stability**: Ensure tight price correlation between similar-value assets
- **Enable Capital Efficiency**: Allow liquidity providers to earn competitive yields with reduced impermanent loss risk

## Future Scope

### Phase 1 - Core Enhancement
- **Multi-Asset Pools**: Support for 3+ stablecoin pools
- **Dynamic Amplification**: Automatic adjustment of amplification coefficient based on market conditions
- **Advanced Fee Structure**: Implement dynamic fees based on pool utilization and volatility

### Phase 2 - Advanced Features
